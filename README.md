WhiteList
=========
Whitelist is a whitelisting plugin that broadcasts new members added to the Whitelist and gives you the abbilety to search trhough the whitelist for a ceratin player!

We use the Whitelist plugin on P.PortalCraft.Se one of my own servers. It works pretty good and every staff member likes the plugin since they can easily walk thourh the whitelisted players and easily whitelist others
Pretty dirty coded so good luck walking through it! :)
